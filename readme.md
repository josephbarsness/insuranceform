Insurance Form - Readme

Introduction -

My father has been a home/auto/business insurance salesperson for 43 years.  As technology has changed my father has struggled to stay competitive with the new 'online insurance' landscape.  I was hopeful to create an 'insurance form' for him to use so if he has someone who needs a quote on their insurance they can go to this app/page/whatever and provide the basic information that my dad needs in order to be able to provide a quote.
